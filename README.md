## Overview

This repo is the self-made notes of Machine Learning course from Hong-yi Lee.

All the notes are in the `./notes/` folder.

This repo is used for owner to document learning outcomes. If it helps you a little, please star it.

## The Recommended Way to Read

All the Markdown files are written by Obsidian. So I recommend you to clone them down and browser them in Obsidian.
