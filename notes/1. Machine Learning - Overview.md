# **Machine Learning**: to look for a **function**.

*Different types of Functions:*

| input    | functions         | output         |
| -------- | ----------------- | -------------- |
| vector   |                   | scaler         |
| matrix   | output = f(input) | classification |
| sequence |                   | text, image    |

## 1. Supervised Learning

Labeled Data ---> Machine
	It's not efficient to collect data for each task.
## 2. Self-supervised Learning 

Unlabeled images ---> Pre train --(fine-tune)-> Downstream Tasks:
	Develop general purpose knowledge.

## 3. Generative Adversarial Network

Unpaired Data ---> To let machine find the functions by self

## 4. Reinforcement Learning

It's challenge to label data in some tasks.
But we can know the results are good or not.

Generate Data ---> Justify the result is good or not

## 5. Anomaly Detection

To give Machine the ability to say "I don't know!".

## 6. Explainable AI

To let AI give out why it would generate the answer like this.

## 7. Model Attack

Adding noise into data ---> To examine the ability of Model

## 8. Domain Adaptation

## 9. Network Compression

## 10. Life-long Learning 

## 11. Meta-learning 

Meta learning (few-shot learning) = Learn to learn
